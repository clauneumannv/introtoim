# Self-portrait exercise

![](January26/ScreenShot.png)


I know it looks funny, and I wish I could make myself look less "angry" :)

I spent a lot of time in this exercise, especially at the beginning and while figuring out each figure's positions. I tried to play with different shapes and colors, starting with the face and continuing with the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and the rest of the body. I was confused about the hair, but I decided to work with two rectangles, as shown in the picture. I moved the order of my figures and the color functions multiple times before getting this result.
